# SecretDiary
A simple programme to lock, unlock, add and get entries from a Diary.

- Initially the `SecretDiary` class is locked, meaning `add_entry` and `get_entries` should throw an error.

- When the user calls `unlock`, `add_entry` and `get_entries` should work as desired.

- When the user calls `lock` again they throw errors again.

## Motivation 
This project was to better my understanding of the OO Principle Encapsulation, to do this I - 
- First organised it into one class.

- Then, when all of the tests are green, reorganise it into classes with high cohesion.
